## Getting the Most from Development Tutorials

In the past few months, I have started learning game development in C# and Unity as a side endeavor. It’s turned out to be a great way to spend some of this quarantine time. A tutorial on the Unity Learn website called Ruby’s 2D Adventure looked pretty close to the type of games that I ultimately want to make, so I started the tutorial and dove in.

Due to switching between Mac and Windows, and a few other events that caused complications, my save files for the tutorial - a tutorial which, up to that point, I had been following to the letter - had become corrupted. My options were to restart, try to find a way to fix the files, or get creative. I got creative.

My new goal was to get back up to the point I was at in the tutorial but within my new project. I coded a few things differently in getting back to where I was, and then it hit me. Tutorials are not meant to be followed to the letter. Tutorials may not even be meant to be completed. They are meant to be followed loosely as you work on a separate project altogether.

I am now in a position where I'm developing a similar but largely different game to the one that I initially started in the Ruby 2D tutorial. The results are better than I could have imagined, and real, deep learning is happening at a great pace. I'm done with code-alongs.

### The Obvious Shortcoming of Tutorial Code-Alongs

Let’s ask ourselves: what are we hoping to have gained from completing a tutorial? Since so many learning resources today center around making a single project, what are we supposed to do with that project once it’s complete? (assuming we did follow the tutorial exactly). Our portfolios are no place for such projects, so, in all likelihood, that application that you just made by coding along with someone is probably going to live exclusively on your hard drive forever. 

In my opinion, what anyone might be hoping to gain from partaking it a tutorial is demonstrable knowledge. Thus, a tutorial is not meant to be followed but *used*. Signing up for a course on Udemy does not include a contract that states you must complete the course in its entirety. You must necessarily use the course to learn what you need to learn. That is all.

In this way, It seems like our time could be better spent by making unique applications that have similar features to the tutorial baseline projects. We can then refer to the tutorial as a guideline, but we can also develop problem-solving skills whilst creating an application that *can* go on your resume. It’s a win-win.

### The Tutorial Challenge Method

After starting to use this learning model, I began to work myself into a pattern with the Ruby 2D tutorial, and I have since utilized this pattern in other web development tutorials that I have looked at in the past few weeks. Each section or chapter of a tutorial is likely to be focused around implementing a lone feature into the tutorial application. Most often, the name of the chapter will serve as a label for the feature that is to be added. I think it’s a great idea to challenge ourselves by reading the name of that feature and trying to add it into our separate application *completely independently*, and to do as much research and problem-solving as necessary to accomplish that challenge. Afterward, we can watch how the tutorial author implements the feature and compare solutions.

This method provides an opportunity for every feature of the tutorial project to serve as a massive learning experience. You will have gained so much more from spending the extra time to implement the feature on your own by doing things like reading documentation, searching posts on Stack Overflow, and possibly even asking questions to other developers. Access to these all-important resources means so much more in your own project than it ever could in a tutorial.

### At What Skill Level Can the Challenge Method be Utilized?

The absolute beginner level. I have spent a great amount of time thinking about and refining my learning process, and I believe it’s true that a beginner can utilize this procedure to amplify his or her learning speed as well as learning quality. At the end of the day, using this method will ensure that it IS going to take much longer to complete the project you’re working on than it would to simply code along with the premade tutorial project, but you will:

* Have something that can be added to your portfolio straightaway
* Have a great deal of extra experience in the oft-overlooked arena of problem-solving.

In a way, this learning style effectively cuts out the “middle man” in the learning process. Very often, people will move directly from a fully coded tutorial project into a similar project that can be developed with their newfound skills. In many cases, and certainly in my case, we will find that following the tutorial closely actually did *not* equip us with the facility to code a similar project on our own, and now we are back to re-watch videos that we watched only weeks or even days earlier. This is frustrating and avoidable.

As a final note, this is not an attack on any tutorial content or content creators. If anything, I want these insights to be viewed as a celebration of how useful this content is. I  also think that many of these creators would appreciate their content being used in this capacity. After all, they want us to learn, and we’re all in this together.

## Doing Something Productive

Today is 3/22/2020, and this marks the official beginning of this blog. Unfortunately, this is also a day of fear and concern for the health and wellbeing of people across the planet.

I have found that, while a little bit of keeping up with daily news is important to know what is happening in the world outside, it is worthwhile (if possible) to keep busy with things that are productive.

To write something useful would be productive. I am going to commit some of this newfound "quarantine time" to start this dev blog.

In the long run, my only hope with this project is to create a resource that will have helped someone learn something along the way.

Thanks for reading.
